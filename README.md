# Open TMS
### Transport Management System on steroids

## Project Description

Open TMS is an innovative open-source Transport Management System designed to revolutionize how logistics companies handle their daily operations. Our mission is to simplify transport management processes while reducing human errors and operational costs.

### What is Open TMS?

Open TMS is a modern solution that combines artificial intelligence, smart communication, and advanced routing capabilities to create an efficient and user-friendly transport management ecosystem. The system is designed to be accessible to companies of all sizes, from small local operators to large logistics enterprises.

### Key Goals

- **Automate Order Processing**: Using AI to automatically read and process transport orders from various formats (emails, PDFs, documents), extracting crucial information like addresses, delivery times, and special requirements without manual input.

- **Smart Route Optimization**: Integration with mapping services to calculate optimal routes, considering factors such as traffic, vehicle capacity, and delivery windows to reduce fuel costs and improve delivery times.

- **Universal Driver Communication**: Providing an inclusive communication system that works for all drivers, regardless of their technology access:
  - Web-based interface accessible via simple URL links
  - SMS-based communication for basic phones
  - No mandatory app installation required
  - Real-time updates and delivery status tracking

### Why Open TMS?

- **Reduce Human Error**: Automated data entry and validation
- **Save Time**: Quick and efficient order processing
- **Cut Costs**: Optimized routes and better resource utilization
- **Improve Communication**: Simple and effective driver-dispatcher interaction
- **Universal Access**: Works with both smart and basic phones
- **Flexibility**: Adaptable to various business sizes and needs

## Why Open Source?

In today's logistics technology landscape, most advanced TMS solutions are expensive, closed-source SaaS platforms that often put small and medium-sized businesses at a disadvantage. Open TMS aims to change this paradigm by providing an open-source alternative that empowers businesses of all sizes.

### Democratizing Transport Management

- **Accessibility**: Small businesses shouldn't have to choose between expensive enterprise solutions and basic spreadsheets. Open TMS provides professional-grade features at a fraction of the cost.

- **Transparency**: Open-source code means you know exactly what's happening with your data and how the system works. No black boxes, no hidden fees, no vendor lock-in.

- **Community-Driven**: By being open source, Open TMS can evolve based on real needs from real users. Features and improvements are driven by the actual requirements of transport companies, not corporate roadmaps.

### Planned Features

- Automated transport orders reading
- Real-time transport management
- Real-time tracking of vehicles and drivers
